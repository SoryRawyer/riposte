### riposte â€” turn TODO comments into github issues

### Usage
Configure a github webhook to send push events to https://nameless-mountain-59891.herokuapp.com/payload

On every code change riposte will:
1. get all TODO issues for a repo
2. download all changed files
3. parse out TODO comments via regex
4. compute SHA1 hash of each comment
5. if the hash is already present, don't make a new issue
6. otherwise, create a new issue with the TODO statement as the title and the hash as the body
